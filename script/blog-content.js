We love you when you come to the rescue, sometimes off the mark, always in our hearts. We love you when you let go of expressions like \" it's falling like in Gravelotte \" when it rains a lot. We love you when you're on the doorstep when we arrive. We love you when you remember our favorite dishes exactly, and we love you when you remember a little less.

Here is the recipe, served with its al dente anecdotes. Ingredients For the dumplings: Exactly, speaking of dumplings: the legendary dinner scene between Lady and Tramp almost never existed! Walt Disney was not convinced by the first sketches. Screenwriter Frank Thomas was a firm believer in this and decided to draw and animate the scene before showing it to Walt Disney. Bingo, it worked! - about 400 gr of meat (depending on your tastes, it can be only beef, a beef / veal mix, in a veggie version with lentils, red beans, cauliflower, tofu etc.) - 25 gr of stale bread (or breadcrumbs) - 1 glass of milk - 15-20 gr of grated parmesan (according to your tastes too, we tend to always add more) - 1 egg - 2 tablespoons of flour - 1 knob of butter - the inseparable duo: salt, pepper Ps: you can also add thyme, bay leaf, parsley... as you like! For the rest: The character of Lady, Beauty, is inspired by Joe Grant's pretty Cocker Spaniel dog, and Clochard is inspired by a real abandoned dog who had found refuge in the Disney studios. It was even the screenwriter of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella who finally adopted it! - 400 gr of spaghetti - 800 gr of tomato pulp - 1 onion - 1 clove of garlic - olive oil - herbs (if you want)",

They sow discord in very quiet classes, they terrorize teachers with long hair, and above all they are... back. Unfortunately, lice have also made their comeback. The My Little Kids team comes out on the counter-attack! We knocked on the door of our friends at Boldie, the media that talks about beauty and care without fuss and without blabla, and we asked them to give us their 4 best effective AND natural remedies against lice. Results ? E-lice-stuffing! Warning: if you suddenly feel like scratching your hair while reading this newsletter, sorry, but we can't help it, we're itchy too. 1. Coconut oil or olive oil These two oils work wonders on infected heads: apply the oil to the hair, like a hair mask. The ideal is to spend the night with it (just to make sure that the lice die in excruciating pain), covering it with a hat / towel, or even a plastic film so that it soaks in really well. If it's too complicated, try to make it fit at least several episodes of Paw Patrol. Then you comb the hair with an anti-lice comb, then you wash it (with lavender shampoo it is the best). 2. Mayo Strange, and yet... in addition to marvelously enhancing fries, mayo also stifles lice and nits (it's so greasy, ahem). The advantage is that it acts faster than oil, 2 or 3 hours is enough. Then, rebelotte, we comb, we wash. Be careful not to use it on children allergic to eggs. 3. Baking soda Attack lice by sprinkling them with baking soda! Once the scalp of your minus (at least 1 year old) is covered with it, massage for a little while. Then, soak the anti-lice comb in water mixed with baking soda and pass it through all the hair. Finally, we wash the hair, and always the same, with a lavender shampoo it's only better. 4. The This is the trick to prevent instead of cure. In the morning before going to school, place a few drops of lavender essential oil on the back of your child's neck and behind their ears. Lice hate that smell and won't settle on his scalp. Ps: we know that there are plenty of other natural remedies, so don't hesitate to share your tested and verified tips with us (at bonsplans@mylittlekids.com ), we will complete our article as we go. .",

            content: "Each month, My Little Paris publishes a way of experiencing Paris, shared by a Parisian. For this new column, we give the pen to Victor Habchy, content creator who became known on Social Networks by asking intimate questions to strangers in the streets of Paris. We talk about him as “the influencer who does things on a bike”, the guy who says  “ How many m2 do you live in? ,  or who asks people what their biggest regret is. It makes him smile. When he posts a video, it comments, it buzzes, and above all it feels good. For this new column, he tells us how social networks have transformed his relationship to himself, and to Paris. “My name is Victor, I'm 30 years old, and I live in Paris. I grew up in Picardy from an Egyptian father and a mother from the South of France. I landed at 18 in Nanterre, to study at university. It wasn't fun… I lived in a 9m2 apartment at the top of a tower and I had trouble acclimatizing. I didn't have a lot of money, so I wandered off to La Défense, to a skate park in the 18th arrondissement, and then I also went to read a book at Fnac. I spent hours standing in the aisles going through photo magazines and reading manga! At that time, Paris was an obligation: I didn't have the shoulders and the codes to face this city that I only knew by its big RER stations: Châtelet, Opéra, Nation…not the real Paris. In fact, I had only one obsession, it was to leave Paris and go travel. I ask them about their greatest regret, the happiest day of their life, the meeting or the event that upset them, the founding phrase or that hurt them the most. Contrary to what people think, I'm really bad at approaching people in the street, I do a little violence, but once the conversation is started, then I know how to listen and create intimacy. I like this moment when we drop the masks and where we enter into the confidence. Me, it makes me feel good to listen to them, them to talk to me, and lots of people find themselves in the stories of others. Meeting these strangers is very powerful, it makes you more humanistic. It allows you to see that behind their facade, people are beautiful. Vulnerable. That in every person you meet on the street, you can find a story worth listening to. We will never go around humans ... or Parisians! »",

Shelby is one of the hosts sponsored by Samantha Wolfson. It was she who invented these dinners last summer: when life pushed her to leave her native Philadelphia for Amsterdam, she sought to enlarge her circle of friends. And what could be better than a dinner in a very small committee to tell each other differently, to reveal themselves, and to leave with the 06 new friends? Since then, these sorority dinners are popping like kernels of popcorn in Amsterdam, London, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Lisbon and Paris. Anyone can be invited or become a host. Just register. The next one in Paris will take place on Thursday March 23. Theme and menu may vary. A word of advice: don't wait too long before reserving your place, only five women can participate in each dinner. Intimate, we said.

On these days, go for a walk in the 12th at the end of the morning. Walk along the Faubourg Saint Antoine then take the rue de Cotte. So far everything is calm. But at the end, at the very end, something is going on. It's the belly of Paris that is stirring: welcome to the Marché d'Aligre. Traders sell the best gourmet products at auction. The baskets are filled with colorful and fragrant stalls with juicy oranges and wild strawberries, melting Bellota ham and Provençal olives... at very low prices. Under the covered market, at Philippe's, you can find almost all the 1000 cheeses of France! Ultimate pleasure after the market, meet at the Baron Rouge, the emblematic wine bar of popular Paris to devour on barrels of charcuterie boards and Corsican cheese around a small glass of white wine. Sunday especially, it's the village atmosphere: it overflows on the sidewalks, everyone seems to know each other, a frenzied neighborhood brass band punctuates the cadence of passers-by, plates of oysters pass through their hands and bottles of Sancerre are placed on the hoods of cars. Unmissable meeting to taste the atmosphere of the village of Aligre! Le Baron Rouge. 1 rue Théophile Roussel au Marché d'Aligre Place d'Aligre 75 012 Paris Metro Ledru Rollin. Open daily from 10am to 10pm and Sunday until 4pm",

So come closer, we present to you the latest exclusive members of the Riquiqui Reading Club. Some time ago, we recruited a panel of children ready to do battle with the bedtime stories found in McDonald's Happy Meal. The goal? Submit the 7 stories to their clear, spontaneous, incisive opinions (well, we asked their parents a little too). Result ? Our mini literary critics have spoken, and you can find all their opinions directly on the Riquiqui Reading Club. As a bonus, we have even planned a catch-up contest if you missed all these great adventures! And if the circle of little poets had not completely disappeared?",

Like the New York Roll, which appeared one fine autumn day in the window of the BO&MIE bakery, and has already been devoured by thousands of Parisians. It has to be said that it has quite a pretty face, this round croissant, with its bronze color and dripping chocolate sauce on a puff pastry and caramelized. At the first croc, we stained our sweater as if we were 4 years old. On the second, oh surprise: unexpected explosion of vanilla cream in the mouth, hidden in the heart of the Roll . On the third, hands lined with cream and mouth smeared with chocolate. We looked smart.

But it's so worth the effort to climb up to this \"Melbourne à Montmartre\" atmosphere café, to order a Golden Latte or a Piccolo Latte with hazelnuts. The baristas to greet: Fred and Charlotte. To take away in the other hand: a chocolate-praline shortbread. Le Café-Tabac  , 1bis Rue Ravignan, 75018 Paris, €2 for an espresso, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., weekends from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. can choose your milk: cow, soy, oats, almond, hazelnut. Boulevard des filles du Calvaire, a Breton canteen has just opened its eyes: the Joa café, which means \"joy\" in Breton, where Anne-Charlotte, fresh out of her training at the Lomi roasting school, prepares smooth filter coffees and full-bodied espressos. The barista to greet: Anne-Charlotte. To take away in the other hand:  the brioche bread-buns or the dark-chocolate cookies and mashed cashew nuts. Café Joa , 20 boulevard des filles du Calvaire, 75003 Paris, €2.50 for an espresso, open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Closed on Tuesdays. It's not just coffee lovers in life: the passionate tea hunters at Chez Thé-ritoires offer tea to take away every week. There was black tea from Malawi, Chinese green tea, and from Monday we're betting everything on Early Grey. The Théristas to salute (no, this word does not yet exist): Arnaud and Maxime. To take away in the other hand : the scone, 5€ for both. Thé-ritoires, 5 Rue de Condé, 75006 Paris, open Tuesday to Saturday 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., €4 for tea and €3.50 if you bring your own cup.
